# FixLenovoContact
<h3>About program</h3>
In some mobile phones on the android, when updating the OS or application "contacts" there are problems with the format of the phone number.<br>
Look at this situations. 
You had about 500 contacts on Android, after the update there may be a problem. 
When someone calls you, then instead of the caller's name you can see only his number. 
That is, the phone does not "see" this contact. 
This happens because of problems with the format of numbers. 
<b>For example</b>, you have contacts recorded as X ХХХ ХХ ХХ, and it is necessary that there would be ХХХХХХХХ.
And with this program you change the phone number formats.
